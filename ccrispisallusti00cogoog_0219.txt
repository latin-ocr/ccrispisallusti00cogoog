tended him in thie war in the character os mester os the artificem.
Murius, who was one os the eounoil of war that tried him, was not
only himself severe against him, but‘stirred up most of the other
judges ς so thet it wne carried against the opinion os Metellus, end
was much ngeinet hie will thet he passed upon him sentence of
death. A affort time ester-werde, according to Plutarch, the neonu-
tion appeared a salse one, end ell the other officere sympathised
with Metellus, who wne overwhelmed with sorrow ς while Marius
with joy declat-ed that the thing was all hie own doin ,end wne not

made of a omen tribune having been seeurged end degreded by
