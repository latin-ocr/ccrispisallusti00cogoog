of the three tribes, and one by Romulus These vere called patres,

increased their number aster the destruction os Alban Tarquinius
Priscus added one hundred motez so that the whole number to the
time os Sylla consisted os about three hundred. After the expul-
sion os Tarquinius Superbus, Brutus selected proper characters to
supply the place of those who had been destroyed by Tarquin‚
whose names were enrolled with the remaining senators, and hence
they were together called patres conscripti. The c itcs did not ori·-
