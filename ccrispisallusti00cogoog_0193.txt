¹ U. 620, gota law passed, called an Agrai-ian law, prohibiting any
person from poseeasingmore than 350 acres os land ς and for distribut-
mg the eur-plue among the poorer citizens. Thia law produced much
dissensioni and confusion, was never executed, and cost the proposes-
his lise. C. Gracchus, supported by his colleague, Μ. Fulvius
Flaccus, pureued the footstepa oi hia brother Tiberius. Both of
them suffered a violent death. [The opinion which has till of late
years universally prevailed, and which is maintained also in the
above note, that the Agrarian lawe-had for their object to cnihte·
an equality of estates, and to prevent any individua! from owning
more than about 350 acres of land, is now completely exploded.
We are indebted ior a· more correct view of the subject to the

· learning and ingenuity oi M. Niehbuhr‚ who has laid down the

true doctrine in hia Roman Histoi-y. “These lawa concerned not
lauded estates, butv public landa, commone, domnina. They limited
not the quantity of land which the Roman citizen had a right to
own and ιο cultivate, but the portion of the public landa which he
had a right to take on lenae from the state. The Roman Patricium
wan aa free to buy os any one who would cell, aa the English ot
American citizen ς but the arrogance os the nobles and the jealouay
of tho tribunes led to a series of lawe limiting the quantity of the
public demaine, which any one might occupy or leuse, to about 350
acres? North American Revievr, New Series. N umber 39.
