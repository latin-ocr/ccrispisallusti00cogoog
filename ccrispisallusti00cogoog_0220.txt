56. Valenti animo. Critics differ with respect to this expression:
most of them will have volenti animo to be the ablative cese3 but
is compared with similar expressions in Sallust and other authors,
we confess ourselves inclined to thinkit will be acknowledged to be
a dative, quae erant being understood. The snm-ture is ester the
Greek model. and the meaning is-heving heard the accounts that
were transmitted concerning Metellus and Marius, they were, in
both cases, such as gratified their inclinatione. l cannot help dif-
fering in opinion from my learned predecessor, an regarding volenti
animo es the ablative. When the passage can be thus explained on
the simplest principles of construction, it seems altogether anneces·
sary to have recourse to a harsh and almost ungrammatical mode of
explanation, which Cortius, however, has nost hesitated to do. Nor
does volenti animo, even supposing it were the dative and that qum
erant were understood, bear any close resemblance to the Greek idi- ·
om. to which Curtius would refer it. The rule for that peculial·
idiom in Greek is as follows ι “The verbs aistand ‚myricen are osten
accompanied by a participle of th'e verb, to wish, διο. in the dative}
in which case the 'participle only. as the leading idea, is translated
by the finite verb„ vid. Matthiae, G. G vol. 2. 9 391. e. Thus, Od-
