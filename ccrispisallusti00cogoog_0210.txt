pelled to give to huic when we translate it into our own idiom.

The meanmg os the whole passage *is as sonows ε’ ln thtis place, ·

the consul stationed a gan-ison, sor the sake attho same time of
sounding the real intentions of J ugurtha, (ι.Δ e. of ascertaining
whethe'r he really desis-ed peuce or was onlyseeking to lay some am-
buscade) and of watching the result os his own plens (Le. the as-
sassination os Jugurth·· by his ambassadors) is the advantages the
place afforded should allow this to be done ; (i. e. if upon tmal the
place should prove as a‹lvantageous sor these two obJects as he had
imagined ς· at it w‘ouid.) ” 'Phe reading adopted by Cottius is this:
Huc consul simul tentandi gratia, si pateram opportunitates loci, p. ο.
The paracle simu! he refers back to the preceding sentence, and
makes Metellus to have been influeneed in the step he took, both by
the circumstance-of there being many Roman trades-s in the city.
