ξ 23. JMos partium popularium, Suc. [The words mos partium would
alone suffice to convey the meaning ,of Sallust, and from popularium
tosactionum might be sasely omitted. This has induced some of
the best commentators to consider the passage as it now stands, to be
extremely corrupt. The import of the words, is we retain from po-
pularium to factionum, will tae.1his,.tne customof having a party of
