³ 94, Suppliciis. sacrifices, worship.. &appui-ium signifies both
punishments and supplicatim, worship or sacrifice ς because the
subject of punishment was supposed both to avert the wrath οἰ the

gods, by suffering, or bearing the penalty on behals of the people ς
and to engage the'deities to listen to their weyers, by being offered
as a sacrifice for their guilt. The goods of criminals were also made
an offering to the offended deity. [Scheller deduces the two mean·
ings of this word in a different manner. He makes the primitive
impert to be, a kneeling down. This may be done either to sup·

j plicate the Deity, whence we have the kindred meaning of reli·
gious worship3 or it may be sor the purpose of being beheaded,
whence we obtain the idea of punishment.]
